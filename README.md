# Project Introduction

This Front End Project allows you to compare your favorite NBA players' statistics from the previous season. It includes metrics for points, assists, rebounds, 3pt%, free throw %, and includes a color comparison feature. As a lifelong NBA fan, I found this the perfect opportunity to use the skills I've learned in my Software Engineering Bootcamp.
